# How to Learn a Programming Language

**Note:** This is a summary or starter guide for learn programming. Check this [Python](https://github.com/Aravindray/Python) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Aravindray/JavaScript) repositories for more in-depth notes.

## Fundamentals

- What is Programming?
	- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. We can communicate with computer with programming languages like humans used to communicate with each others.
	- Programmers are the person who instruct computers what to do by writing a set of codes with the help of programming languages. The program is than translated into machine code (1's and 0's) with the help of compiler.
